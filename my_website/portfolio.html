                 <p> The game I have made on Scratch, is called "Princess Peach SHELL Die" (as shown on the left picture). In mine (& Phuc's) game, the purpose is to defend Princess Peach from the Goombas. The way to defeat the Goombas is to use the paddle to control the shells and aim them to hit the goomba. Once a goomba dies, another respawns. The aim is to kill as many goombas as you can, before Princess Peach loses 3 lives. So in order to make this game happen, Phuc and I needed to figure out how to get the Goomba to chase after Peach. The way we did this was by setting an "if" statement. We stated that "if" the goomba's distance from Peach is greater than 0, then the goomba will forever walk 1 step in Peach's direction. We would increase the number of steps after passing a certain score. Another script we would use was how to make the shell look like it was spinning. The way we did this was by having 2 costumes: one which the shell faces left and one which the shell faces right. We would use a forever loop, that would keep switching from one costume to the next costume. We would make the costumes change every 0.0001 seconds, thus allowing the shell to look like it is spinning. Some difficulties we had was finding the time outside of class to work on the project, especially with the physics Q1 final coming up. Ultimately, this was a really fun project to work, since making a game had been an old childhood dream of mine, so it was fun to finally make my own game. </p>

                 <p> The story of Minh Vinh Nguyen is about revolves around his college life, as a law student in OCC. He has a pretty crazy love life as well. But throughout the story, he must decide between two things: himself or his lover. </p>
                 <p> Producing this story was most difficult in the script writing. Figuring out the different endings that would be available was the main step in creating such a story. This was a really easy project to code as well, since all I had to do was follow a certain layout: defining each decision point and creating if-else statements to determine which path or endings the character will go through. So in order to effectively produce this program, I had to know how to create if-else statements and how to allow the users to input their answer (using raw_input). One of the problems that Phuc and I went through when coding this project was spelling. Because this is a computer language, there is no auto correct to fix incorrect spelling or grammer in the story itself. So when looking back at the code, we saw that there were a lot of typos. To fix this, we copied and pasted each script of story to google docs, in order to find any spelling or grammatical errors.  </p>
                 <p> I felt really proud of my work in this project. It had such a simple elegance to the story, the structure, and the coding. Plus, the script was very enjoyable to make and the end result of the story was hilarious! One story that I found interesting was one written by Minh-Khoi and AJ. Their story revolved around the Life of Phuc. I found it to be very interesting because of the ridiculousness of the endings. For example, at least 2 endings involve aliens and dying because of aliens. But of course, my story is better than theirs LOL. </p>
                 <p> Ultimately, if I had to chance to do this project again, I would add more decision points to make the story more in depth. I would also provide more detailed narratives after each decision point, to provide imagery to the users. </p>
